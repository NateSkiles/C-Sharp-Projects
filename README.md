### [Console Applications](/ConsoleApplications/)
Here is a collection of mostly console apps that I wrote to help me learn C#. I have named most of the project's names directly after the concept they are supposed to be demonstrating. There are a few web applications included as well that only covered a single idea.

As a hands-on learner, these apps allowed me to break or change things in the code from my lessons better understand abstract concepts and how they might interact.

### [Final Challenge](/FinalChallenge/)
A simple .NET Framework MVC Web Application, that when run, creates a code-first database using the Entity Framework. This a bare-bones project that I intend to add more functionality too. After generating the database, I instantiate a student class and save it to the database.

### [.NET Core Web App (aspDotNetCore_WebApp)](/aspDotNetCore_WebApp/)
A .NET Core Web Application that simply displays a web page with my name and a message with the current time and date. I used Razor syntax in this project to render C# code with HTML.


### [Car Insurance](/CarInsurance/)
Another .NET Framework MVC Web Application creates a database using the Entity Framework and the database first concept. From an existing database model, the program creates classes for the MVC application using the Entity Framework.

The application takes in information from the user and then generates a car insurance quote for that user, based on their input and logic from the MVC Controller. The controller is responsible for calculating the insurance quote and then saving that information to the database.

### [News Letter App - MVC](/NewsletterAppMVC/)
Using LINQ to make queries to a database.

### [Students MVC](/TechAcadStudentsMVC/)
Creates a MVC application with Models.


### [Black Jack Game](/BlackJackGame/)
A console game of Black Jack that applies the concepts I learned making all of the other console applications: e.g. error handling, polymorphism and inheritance, different classes in C#, etc.
